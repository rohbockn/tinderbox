# Working with the Splunk SDK for Python

## Setup
1. Visit https://dev.splunk.com/python, and download the SDK
2. Use the guide included for reference, but for documentation, here's what I did:

- I moved the sdk into infrastructure ```mv ~/Downloads/splunk-sdk-python-1.6.6.zip ~/Infrastructure/```
- I extract there
- Open the directory in terminal
- ```pip install --user splunk-sdk```
- Add the following to your```export PYTHONPATH=~/Infrastructure/splunk-sdk-python-1.6.6```
