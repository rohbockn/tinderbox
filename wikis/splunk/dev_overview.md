# Developing on local Splunk

For reasons I don't completely comprehend yet, you need to have npm/nvm installed.

How to:
1. Originally I used the git method outlined here: https://github.com/creationix/nvm#git-install
2. That wasn't enough, I had to follow the advice given here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/26477536/8469286.
- Note: I only performed the export ```export NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR=http://nodejs.org/dist``` which I also added to my .bashrc file
3. Install node - see usage section of https://github.com/creationix/nvm#git-install
