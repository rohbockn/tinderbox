# Intro to using JavaScript
I'm going to be doing this by using a 'case' study, so to speak.  My first project will be programming a custom visualization using plotly.

First thing is to think of this as a project.  As such, create a directory for the project.

Into that directory, download the js library for plotly:
'''wget https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js'''
